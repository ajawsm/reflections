When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on multiple machines or with a group of people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If multiple people are working on the file and you've been working for a while,
your changes and version may not mesh with changes from other users, causing issues
when it automatically merges your code while you are working on your local machine.
